                <h1>A Letter to the Editor</h1>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    In our good book of Ecclesiastes chapter four verse nine it says “When individuals work together, they can double their strength and get much more done as a team.” However, in my experience in this great colony of Pennsylvania, the opposite seems to ring true. The land here is rich, everyone owns their own portion of it. There aren’t any beggars in sight. However, instead of working to farm together, Pennsylvania thrives off competition.

                    Upon my research, I came across the writing of a German immigrant's experience in this colony. He proclaimed that here in Pennsylvania, “the people live so far from one another that many a one has to walk fifteen minutes or half an hour to get to his nearest neighbor. The reason is because many a farmer has 50 or 100 and even 200—400
                    acres of land”(Middleburg Journey). The people of Pennsylvania have much by themselves. They come here, work, acquire land and then acquire more land. The fertile soil of this country is limitless.

                    From this soil, a man of Pennsylvania harvests many goods and sells them to his neighbor and to market. From the bible’s literal sense, this is not working together. He who sells is he who profits, not he who helps his brethren. However, in Pennsylvania, this competition seems to actually bring about a double strength. Every man grows rich from his own land and the goods he has bought and sold. Because of the vastness of Pennsylvania, every man has a place to accumulate wealth. Each man, by working hard to succeed, brings about the success of another man. This is by selling him goods he cannot produce on his own, teaching apprentices techniques and trade(for a price) that helps them with their own vision for success, and making marriage easier and consequently childbearing.

                    This is not to say that working together doesn’t bring about the strength the Bible spoke of. There are plenty of communities in Pennsylvania that participate in almost all aspects of life cooperatively. For example, the Amish farm together, build houses together, and take care of livestock together. Their lifestyle is based on cooperation and they are quite successful.

                    Although I am a man of God I am also a man of observation and I have witnessed men working alone and bringing great success as if men had worked together.

                <h1>The Price of Freedom</h1>

                    My beautiful city upon a hill has grown. What was the foundation now exists in Pennsylvania.  The liberty to practice whatever religion under God suits one is a unique privilege and right to all who live here.  The soil is fertile and lands seemingly endless. This colony truly is a place where a man with nothing can become a man with everything. This extraordinary colony, however, comes with a price. It looms over all our heads and watches us from the forest. 
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                    I am a quaker. Our foundation aims to prevent violence anywhere and everywhere. However in the colonies, if a man wants the possibility of everything he must take it, by force, from another. Before we came to this glorious land it was full of Indians living in their own harmony. When our people came to it we carved it from their hands, engaged in bloody battles, ripped the child from mother and mother from the husband. Even then that wasn’t enough. We engage in a brutal slave trade, which forces countless men into the dreadful middle passages, worse than most can imagine. Although practice of slavery itself is less violent here in Pennsylvania, the way in which we capture these slaves is entire against Quaker values and values of freedom. 
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                    The way in which we farm our land differs from that of the Indians. Where they farm for sustenance we farm for profit. I see no wrong in this, but because of the demand of our ambition, we are forced to exploit every bit of fertility left in the soil. This damages our environment and forces settlers to look elsewhere, violently conquer more land, and brutally acquire more slaves for it. 
                </p>
                
                <br/>
                
                <p>
                    All this for freedom. The question we must ask ourselves before we pursue our happiness, liberty, and freedom is if the cost is worth it? To turn our heads from our quaker values for the sake of freedom paid for in bloodshed? That is a question we must answer in order to proceed and to which I hope we all answer no.
